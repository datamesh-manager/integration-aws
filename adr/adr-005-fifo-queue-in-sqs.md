# FIFO Queue in SQS for Event Buffering

**Date:** 2023-07-06

## Context

In our system, events from the Data Mesh Manager need to be processed reliably and efficiently. To ensure robust event processing, we need to implement a buffering mechanism that can handle fluctuations in event volume and provide reliable delivery. We have considered different options for event buffering, including various message queue systems. We need to decide whether to use a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for event buffering, considering its reliability and ordering guarantees.

## Decision

We have decided to use a FIFO queue in Amazon SQS for event buffering. This decision is based on the following considerations:

1. **Reliable Event Delivery:** FIFO queues in SQS provide reliable event delivery with exactly-once semantics. This ensures that each event is delivered to the consumer in the order it was received, minimizing the risk of data loss or out-of-order processing.

2. **Ordered Event Processing:** By leveraging a FIFO queue, we can guarantee the order of event processing. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the event stream and ensuring that downstream systems consume events in the expected order.

3. **Scalability and Resilience:** SQS FIFO queues are highly scalable and resilient. They can handle large volumes of events and automatically scale to accommodate increased throughput. Additionally, SQS provides redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring that events are not lost due to failures or disruptions.

4. **Buffering and Throttling:** FIFO queues act as a buffer between the Data Mesh Manager and the event processing system. They can handle variations in event arrival rates, allowing the event processing system to consume events at a pace it can handle. This buffering capability helps decouple the processing speed of the event consumer from the event generation rate.

## Consequences

- Ensures reliable and ordered event delivery through FIFO queues in SQS.
- Guarantees the processing order of events, maintaining the integrity of the event stream.
- Provides scalability, resilience, and fault tolerance for handling large volumes of events.
- Acts as a buffer to handle variations in event arrival rates, decoupling event generation from processing.
- Introduces additional overhead and complexity in managing and monitoring the SQS FIFO queues.
- Requires careful configuration to handle scaling and throttling appropriately.
